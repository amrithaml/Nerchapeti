    <h1 id="sizee" style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">Anti-Money Laundering Policy</h1>
    <h2> I. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY </h2>
    <p>1. The company is committed to ensuring that it maintains ethical business practices, complies with applicable
        law and its crowdfunding platform is not used for funding illegal activities. To achieve this objective, we have
        prepared this Anti-Money Laundering Policy <span style="font-weight:bold">
            (“AML Policy”)</span> and request you to carefully read and follow the policy. This policy is in addition to
        your obligations under applicable laws on the prevention of money laundering and does not detract in any manner
        from those obligations. We urge you to be aware of your obligations under such applicable laws. The company’s
        ability to comply with its obligations under applicable law is dependent on your cooperation and we seek your
        cooperation via this policy.</p>
    <p>2. To ensure that we are not involved in any transactions that are known or suspected to be means of laundering
        money if any suspicious activity is noticed, users of this platform are urged to promptly contact government
        authorities to facilitate any action that may be needed. </p>
    <p>3. This money laundering policy applies to all persons using and accessing this web platform. This includes all
        donors, contributors, campaigners, and persons visiting our platform. All these persons are collectively
        referred to as <span style="font-weight:bold">“Users”</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold">“users”.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>II. WHAT CONSTITUTES MONEY LAUNDERING AND SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS</h2>
    <p>1. “Money laundering” is largely understood to mean any act or attempt (directly or indirectly and even by
        association in one step of a series of transactions) to conceal or disguise the origin and ownership of proceeds
        obtained illegally, such that it appears to have originated from legitimate sources; thus avoiding prosecution,
        conviction and confiscation of such proceeds. Terrorist organisations, tax evaders, smugglers, persons involved
        in bribery or any persons that receive money for illegal activities and/or through illegal means may launder
        money.</p>
    <p>2. Recognising transactions involving money laundering requires awareness of possible suspicious activity, which
        may arise at any time. Below is an indicative list of actions that persons associated with the company should be
        careful of. This list is not exhaustive, as every circumstance is not foreseeable. However, regardless of
        appearing together or individually, please be aware of the following situations that may be indications of money
        laundering activity: </p>
    <ol type="i">
